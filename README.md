## Technical experience

I did take an HTML/CSS course and a VB course in high school but I'll admit I forgot literally everything (though the VB one did teach me basic logic that has stuck with me pretty well). At the place I transferred from we did mostly C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio and I also took a SQL course sort of on a whim. That had its ups and downs because on one hand I was pretty prepared for the C part of the System-level programing class I took last semester and the SQL stuff I'm doing in my current Database class and the group project for this class, but on the other hand I came in rather clueless about how Grand Valley CS classes do things and had to essentially teach myself Python for Discrete Structures 2.
